# MC-Template-Creator
Creates/Downloads templates for resource packs, mods and datapacks.

This is mostly a project for me to learn Kotlin a bit better, as well as making a tool that I would find useful.

This tool creates all the folders for a resource pack, or datapack, and the .mcmeta file, so all you need to do is add the textures and other changes.

For mods, it just downloads the latest version from @fabricmc

# Use

To use it, just run it, click on what you want and fill out the required info, then, it should go back to the main menu, and you should have a folder, with the name of your resource pack. If you want to use it, just put the folder in your resourcepacks folder and it should appear in game (The same goes for datapacks too!)
